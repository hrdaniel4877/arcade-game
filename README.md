# Classic Arcade Game



### Description
This is a game developed as a project for the Udacity & Google Front End Web Developer Scholarship.
The game runs entirely in the browser and is written in plain ES5 & ES6 JavaScript.
The purpose of the game is to vertically cross, from bottom to top, the road patrolled by enemy bugs.


### Dependecies
This project was built using Udacity's boilerplate that contains the following files:
  * js\app.js
  * js\engine.js
  * js\resources.js
  * css\style.css
  * images\
  * index.html

No special library has been used.


### Installation
Not required.
Clone on your computer and open the index.html file in your favorite browser to play.


### Usage
Open in your browser the index.html file after cloning the project.
Your character starts at the bottom, in the green area.
Use the arrow key to move your character top, down, left or right.

The purpose of the game is to cross the 3 lanes in the middle to reach the top blue area. 

The 3 central lanes are constantly patrolled by enemy bugs, marching left to right at random speeds.
The player must avoid the collision with the enemy bugs; in case of collision, the player loses and the game is reset. 

Once crossed in the top blue area, the player is safe again. 
One more Up Arrow Key press will reset the game.
The player can also choose to cross back the road, to the green area without resetting the game.
